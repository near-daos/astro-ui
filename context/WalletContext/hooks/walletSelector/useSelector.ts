/**
 * The login process is very fragile and tricky.
 * The main thing to know is that "selector" instance is being instantiated ONCE for the app.
 * It's the time when it reads info from local storage, figures out if you were logged in, what is your wallet, etc.
 * After that instance object lives inside of the wallet-selector library until app lives and it won't
 * update even if you try to create it once more.
 *
 * The login process works in a following way. We open a new window where "/callback/selectorLogin" page is loaded.
 * The app in this "secondary" window has it's own instance of the "selector". Then user is being navigated to
 * wallet to log into it. Wallet navigates user back to "/callback/selectorLogin" after login process. Proper keys are
 * being written into local storage on the "/callback/selectorLogin".
 * NOTE: "selector" is not instantiated in the "main" window with main app for now.
 *
 * Only when proper keys are in local storage and "secondary" window has authenticated user, we send a signal that
 * selector can be created in the "main" window. Selector sees all proper info in the local storage and creates
 * authenticated instance.
 *
 * NOTE: we need to reload page when user logs out to destroy "selector" instance in the window. Otherwise the flow
 * will stop working.
